* Description
An R6RS Scheme Infix Arithmetic Calculator.
Supports +, -, **, *, %, ( and ), and works with floating point numbers.
To set the output as Decimal, uncomment the necessary line in the file.
Exercise caution when using Decimal output, as Scheme has infinite precision.
It should work with all R6RS Scheme Implementations, and has been tested with Chez and Guile Scheme
* Usage
For Chez, append at the top of the file:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
#!/usr/bin/chez --script
#+END_SRC
For Guile, append at the top of the file:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
#!/usr/bin/guile -s
!#
#+END_SRC
For other R6RS compliant scheme implementations, check the 'script' header for your implementation and add it to the top of this file.
To evaluate an expression, do:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./infix.scm "<expression>"
#+END_SRC
